        Wednesday is an American coming-of-age supernatural mystery television
        series based on the character Wednesday Addams by Charles Addams.
        Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega as the
        titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie
        McShane, Hunter Doohan, Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday,
        Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, and Moosa Mostafa
        appearing in supporting roles. Four out of the eight episodes of the
        first season were directed by Tim Burton, who also serves as executive
        producer. It revolves around Wednesday Addams, who attempts to solve a
        murder mystery at her new school.
      </p>
      <p id="para2">
        Burton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film The Addams
        Family and was involved with a cancelled stop-motion animated The Addams
        Family film. In October 2020, he was reported to be helming a television
        series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. Ortega was cast
        in part to represent the character's Latina heritage. Ricci, who had
        played the titular character in the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel Addams
        Family Values, was asked by Burton to join the series in a supporting
        role. Filming took place in Romania between September 2021 and March
        2022.
      </p>
      <p id="para3">
        Wednesday premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on
        November 23 to predominantly positive reviews from critics, who praised
        Ortega's performance.[3] Within three weeks of release, it became the
        second-most watched English-language Netflix series. It received two
        Golden Globe nominations: Best Television Series - Musical or Comedy and
        Best Actress - Television Series Musical or Comedy for Ortega. It also
        won four Primetime Emmy Awards, while receiving nominations for
        Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy
        Series. In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.

      <h2>Premise</h2>
      <hr />
      <p id="para4">
        Wednesday Addams is expelled from her school after dumping live piranhas
        into the school's pool in retaliation for the boys' water polo team
        bullying her brother Pugsley. Consequently, her parents Gomez and
        Morticia Addams enroll her at their high school alma mater Nevermore
        Academy, a private school for monstrous outcasts, in the town of
        Jericho, Vermont. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her
        defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates
        and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal Larissa Weems.
        However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's psychic abilities,
        which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.

      <hr />
      <h3>1.Wednesday's Child Is Full of Woe</h3>
      <p id="para5">
        Wednesday Addams, a high-school student, finds her brother Pugsley tied
        up in a locker. She sees a psychic vision of his bullies, whom she then
        attempts to kill, resulting in her expulsion. Her parents, Morticia and
        Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, their alma mater and a
        school for outcasts in Jericho, Vermont. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by
        an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday's parents release Thing, a
        sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate
        Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl,
        after Bianca bullies a boy named Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly
        killed by a falling gargoyle, but is saved by Bianca's ex-boyfriend
        Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday
        meets Tyler, a barista, who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore.
        However, she is apprehended by Principal Larissa Weems and taken back to
        the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local carnival, and
        Wednesday has a vision of Rowan's death. Rowan attempts to kill her but
        is murdered by a monster.
      </p>
      <h3>2.Woe Is the Loneliest Number</h3>
      <p id="para6">
        Wednesday convinces a skeptical Sheriff Galpin that the perpetrator of
        the murders is in fact a monster. Suddenly, Rowan reappears unharmed.
        Wednesday doubts her sanity and decides to investigate the murders
        herself. She roams the campus inquiring about Rowan and is told that he
        has been expelled. Meanwhile, Weems grows worried about Wednesday's
        visions, keeping close tabs on her. Wednesday confronts a defensive
        Rowan as he leaves the school and sends Thing to follow him. Thing loses
        him and Rowan is revealed to be Principal Weems, who has shapeshifted
        into him. Wednesday has visions of a book belonging to an old students'
        society. In her search for the book, she overhears Bianca planning to
        rig the upcoming student tournament. Wednesday joins Enid to defeat
        Bianca and win the tournament. Later, Wednesday discovers a hidden
        library within the school, where she is captured.
      </p>
      <h3>3.Friend or Woe</h3>
      <p id="para7">
        Wednesday finds herself tied up and surrounded by members of an elite
        students' society, including Bianca and Xavier. Wednesday frees herself
        and leaves the library, taking one of the books with her. Weems orders
        Wednesday to accompany the high school band to an upcoming town ceremony
        run by Mayor Noble Walker. A drawing in the purloined book leads her to
        an exhibition at a local fair, where she notices the painting of a girl
        she had seen in her visions. In the forest, Wednesday envisions the
        girl—believed to be an ancestor of hers—escaping the execution of the
        town's outcasts at the hands of its founder, Joseph Crackstone.
        Wednesday is ambushed by the monster, which she discovers, by its
        footprints, to be human. Back in town, Wednesday disrupts the ceremony
        by having Thing destroy a commemorative statue of Joseph Crackstone and
        is scolded by Principal Weems. While investigating a crime scene in the
        forest, police find a camera that captured photographs of the monster.
      </p>
      <h3>4.Woe What a Night</h3>
      <p id="para8">
        Wednesday and Thing break into the coroner's office to copy the files of
        the monster's victims. In trying to identify a pattern, she finds that
        each victim has had body parts surgically removed. Wednesday becomes
        suspicious of Xavier and follows him into his art studio, where she
        discovers several drawings of the monster, which lead her to the
        monster's cave. There, she retrieves one of its claws and gives it to
        Sheriff Galpin for DNA matching. Wednesday and Tyler attend a school
        dance together. Meanwhile, classmate Eugene, who is privy to Wednesday's
        investigative work, witnesses a cloaked figure blow up the monster's
        cave. The dance is interrupted by Mayor Walker's son, Lucas, who
        triggers the building's fire sprinklers in revenge for Wednesday's
        disruption of the town ceremony. Wednesday senses that Eugene is in
        danger and heads into the forest, only to find him gravely injured by
        the monster.
      </p>
      <h3>5.You Reap What You Woe</h3>
      <p id="para9">
        32 years earlier, Gomez Addams was arrested at Nevermore on suspicion of
        killing Garrett Gates, a descendant of Joseph Crackstone. In present
        time, the Addamses visit Wednesday on Parents' Weekend at Nevermore. A
        family therapy session is cut short when Wednesday confronts her parents
        about the suspected murder. Meanwhile, Sheriff Galpin learns that the
        coroner committed suicide after admitting to fabricating Gates's autopsy
        report. Galpin concludes that Gomez is guilty and arrests him. In
        prison, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that he was covering for Morticia,
        who actually killed Garrett. Wednesday and Morticia dig up Garrett's
        grave to find that he had been lethally poisoned before he was killed,
        but are caught by police and arrested for the night. Later, they
        confront Mayor Walker, who reveals that Garrett intended to poison the
        entire school due to his father's hate for outcasts. Mayor Walker agrees
        to release Gomez after admitting to covering up Garrett's motive. Back
        at Nevermore, Principal Weems reluctantly admits to covering up Rowan's
        death by means of shapeshifting in an effort to evade controversy at the
        school.
      </p>
      <h3>6.Quid Pro Woe</h3>
      <p id="para10">
        Wednesday attempts to summon Goody, an ancestor and fellow psychic who
        killed Crackstone. During a surprise birthday party, Wednesday has a
        vision of Goody, who instructs her to seek out the Gates mansion. There,
        she witnesses Mayor Walker as he is leaving the building and sneaks into
        his car. After arriving back in town, Mayor Walker is hit by a car and
        severely injured. Principal Weems locks down the school and forbids
        Wednesday to leave campus. With Tyler and Enid's help, she escapes and
        returns to the Gates mansion. There, they discover that Laurel Gates,
        Garrett's younger sister, long believed to be dead, might still be
        alive. They find the severed body parts of the monster's victims in a
        cellar, but are forced to flee after being ambushed by the monster.
        Wednesday leads Galpin to the cellar, only to find it empty. At
        Nevermore, Wednesday convinces Weems not to expel her to further pursue
        her investigation. At the hospital, an unknown figure kills Mayor
        Walker.
      </p>
      <h3>7.If You Don't Woe Me by Now</h3>
      <p id="para11">
        At Mayor Walker's funeral, Wednesday notices a lurking figure and chases
        it into the forest. The figure is revealed to be Uncle Fester, who
        explains to Wednesday that the monster she has been investigating is a
        Hyde. Together, they retrieve a diary from the hidden library which
        reveals that a Hyde must always have a master. Later, they track and
        follow Xavier, who they witness meeting up with Dr. Kinbott, Wednesday's
        therapist, in the forest. After returning from a date with Tyler,
        Wednesday finds her dorm room vandalized, the diary stolen, and Thing
        gravely injured. Research into Laurel Gates reveals that she is both
        alive and the master of the Hyde. Wednesday initially suspects Dr.
        Kinbott, but Kinbott is killed by the Hyde. Police arrive to arrest
        Xavier, who Wednesday believes to be the Hyde. Wednesday meets with
        Tyler and kisses him but suddenly has a vision of him being the Hyde and
        runs off.
      </p>
      <h3>8.A Murder of Woes</h3>
      <p id="para12">
        Wednesday and her classmates kidnap Tyler, and Wednesday tortures him to
        try to make him confess. Appalled by her methods, her classmates alert
        Principal Weems, and Wednesday is arrested. At the police station, Tyler
        secretly confesses to Wednesday that he is the monster. Fed up with
        Wednesday's antics, Weems expels her from Nevermore. Wednesday,
        accompanied by Weems, visits Eugene at the hospital, whose description
        of the figure he saw at the monster's cave matches Ms. Thornhill, a
        teacher at Nevermore. Weems, disguised as Tyler, and Wednesday get
        Thornhill to confess that she is Laurel Gates and manipulated Tyler into
        killing the victims as part of her scheme to resurrect Joseph Crackstone
        and wipe out all outcasts. However, Laurel kills Weems and subdues
        Wednesday. Using Wednesday's blood, Laurel resurrects Crackstone and
        leaves Wednesday to die, but Goody appears and heals her. Enid, having
        finally transformed into her werewolf form, defeats Tyler in his Hyde
        form while Crackstone breaches Nevermore. With Bianca's help, Wednesday
        destroys and kills Crackstone, and Eugene helps defeat Laurel. Xavier is
        released from prison, Tyler is detained, and Wednesday departs
        Nevermore, which is closing for the remainder of the semester.

      <h2>Production</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p id="para13">
        During pre-production on The Addams Family (1991), Tim Burton was
        approached to direct, but ended up passing on it due to scheduling
        conflicts with Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992), resulting in
        Barry Sonnenfeld taking the job.[6][7] In March 2010, it was announced
        that Illumination Entertainment had acquired the underlying rights to
        the Addams Family drawings.[8] The film was planned to be a stop-motion
        animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Burton was
        set to co-write, co-produce, and possibly direct the film.[9] In July
        2013, it was reported that the film was cancelled,[10] which, according
        to Burton, was due to the studio favoring a computer-animated approach
        over the stop-motion technique.
      </p>
      <p id="para14">
        Showrunners Miles Millar and Alfred Gough started developing story ideas
        in 2019. They subsequently acquired the rights to the intellectual
        property before writing a pilot script, which they sent to Burton.[12]
        To their surprise, Burton immediately became interested upon receiving
        the script.[13] Commenting about his decision to join the project,
        Burton stated that he could relate to the titular character's worldview
        and that the script "spoke to me about how I felt in school and how you
        feel about your parents, how you feel as a person. It gave the Addams
        Family a different kind of reality. It was an interesting
        combination."[11] Millar stated that it was "very important" to the
        creative team not to emulate the prior films and 1964 television
        series.[13] Millar and Gough decided to make the juxtaposition of
        "outcasts" and "normies", as well as criticism of colonial Americans,
        major themes in the series.
      </p>
      <p id="para15">
        In October 2020, Wednesday was initially announced as an unnamed Addams
        Family project being helmed by Burton. The series's production would be
        handled by MGM Television, with Burton as director. Gough and Millar
        would serve as showrunners, while Gough, Millar, and Burton would also
        be executive producers alongside Gail Berman, Jon Glickman, and Andrew
        Mittman.[15] In February 2021, Netflix gave the production a series
        order consisting of eight episodes.[16] In August 2021, Kayla Alpert was
        added as an executive producer and 1.21, Tee and Charles Addams
        Foundation, and Glickmania were also producing the series.[17] Deemed
        his "first real foray into television", Burton directed four out of the
        eight episodes,[13] with Gandja Monteiro and James Marshall directing
        the remaining episodes.[18] Burton brought on regular collaborator
        Colleen Atwood as costume designer.
      </p>
      <p id="para16">
        On possible future seasons, Gough and Millar commented in an interview
        with Variety, "when we sit down to create a show, it's looking at
        multiple seasons, ideally. That's never expected, but that's the
        anticipation that hopefully the show is successful." They further stated
        that they had "a pretty clear runway" of how future seasons could
        unfold.[19] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Gough and
        Millar stated that the second season would expand upon the friendship
        between Wednesday and Enid while also evolving Wednesday's relationship
        with her mother, Morticia.[20] Ortega stated that the season would "lean
        into the horror aspect" while "ditching any romantic love interest for
        Wednesday".[21] Preparations for a second season commenced in December
        2022, following Amazon's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[22] In
        January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season,[23] with
        Ortega now also serving as producer.
